\problemname{Integrity for spies}

Two friends decide to communicate with each other using a secret code over numbers from $0$ to $ b-1$.
Each message can be arbitrarily long, but it must be validated using the following formula:
\begin{displaymath}
\mbox{current value of the message} = 
 (\mbox{value of the message read so far})*b + 
 \mbox{new number read}.
\end{displaymath}

The {\tt current value of the message} at  the end of the message must be a multiple of $k$.

\section*{Input}

The input starts with $n$, the number of test cases, on a line by
itself.  The remainder of the file contains $n$ test cases.  Each test
case consists of $b$, $m$ (the number of messages in this test case),
and $k$ on lines by themselves, followed by $m$ messages one per line,
each line terminated by a $-1$.  You may assume $2 \leq b \leq 36$.
Schematically, the input looks like
\begin{verbatim}
n
b_1
m_1
k_1
message 1 of test case 1
...
message m1 of test case 1
...
b_2
m_2 
k_2
m_2 messages of test case 2
the other n-2 test cases
\end{verbatim}


\section*{Output}
Output is a sequence of $0$'s and $1$'s, $1$ for valid messages and
$0$ for those that are non-valid, i.e., $n$ binary strings (each of
length $m_i$ for test case $i$). Messages with numbers larger than $b-1$
should be considered invalid.
