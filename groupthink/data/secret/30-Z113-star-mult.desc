The group (Z_113*, x).
   - note that Z_113* = {1, 2, 3, ..., 112}, but we index these elements
     as {0, 1, 2, ..., 111} to be consistent with the problem description
   - 1 (indexed as 0) is the multiplicative identity, although this is disguised
     by the fact that we randomly "relabel" the elements (i.e., permute the indices)
   - table entries are in random order
